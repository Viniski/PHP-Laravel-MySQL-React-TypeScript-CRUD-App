# PHP-Laravel-MySQL-React-TypeScript-CRUD-App

I completed the recruitment task. I used PHP + Laravel and React + Typescript. For application styles I used bootstrap - quite a quick tool, good for recruitment tasks and lack of time. Applications can be run locally.

Clone the repository, run locally in XAMPP Apache and MySQL, create a local database in MySQL called "laravel", then perform migrations:

```zsh
php artisan migrate
```

Start the backend:

```zsh
php artisan serve
```

And then the frontend:

```zsh
npm run dev
```

And open apps on localhost.

The request could be refined, but due to the lack of time in the last few days, I am sending it in this form.
Regards
